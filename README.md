# SIMPLE-HOST-WEBSERVER-USING-ESP822-OLED-
This project uses an ESP8266 (NodeMCU) to create a simple web server that can be accessed from any browser on the same Wi-Fi network. A 1.96-inch OLED display is used to show the server status and IP address once the server is successfully started. This allows real-time visual feedback on the device itself.
